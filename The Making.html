        The film adaptation, directed by Robert Wise and produced by 20th
        Century Fox, was greenlit in the early 1960s. Julie Andrews, fresh from
        her success in "Mary Poppins," was cast as Maria, while Christopher
        Plummer was chosen to play Captain Georg von Trapp. Filming took place
        in various locations, including Salzburg, Austria, and the 20th Century
        Fox studios in California.

        During production, the crew faced several challenges, including
        weather-related delays and logistical issues in Austria. However, the
        picturesque settings, combined with the memorable score by Rodgers and
        Hammerstein, contributed to the film's charm. The film’s musical
        numbers, such as "Do-Re-Mi," "My Favorite Things," and "Climb Ev'ry
        Mountain," became iconic.

      <p>Lehman once said of the music:</p>
      <h2 class="large-quote">
        <em
          >“[The Sound of Music] is not to be a picture in which we feel
          slightly apologetic every time anyone sings. On the contrary, our aim
          is to be slightly apologetic every time anyone talks.”</em
