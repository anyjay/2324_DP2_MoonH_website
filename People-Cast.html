      <h3 class="black-color">Julie Andrews (Maria von Trapp)</h3>
      <h4 class="small-yellow-text">(1935-Present)</h4>

      <p>
        In 1965, Julie Andrews was a rising star when she played Maria in "The
        Sound of Music." Having just achieved significant success with her role
        in "Mary Poppins," for which she won an Academy Award, Andrews brought a
        mix of warmth, charm, and a powerful singing voice to the role of Maria.
        Her portrayal of the spirited governess who brings joy and music to the
        von Trapp family captured audiences' hearts and solidified her status as
        a leading actress in Hollywood. Andrews' performance, characterized by
        her clear, melodic voice and engaging screen presence, was a key factor
        in the film's enduring popularity and critical acclaim.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of today, Julie Andrews is celebrated as a legendary figure in the
        entertainment industry, known for her extensive career in film, stage,
        and television. After "The Sound of Music," she continued to take on
        diverse roles in movies like "Victor/Victoria" and the "Princess
        Diaries" series. Although her singing career was impacted by a vocal
        surgery in 1997, which limited her ability to sing, Andrews has remained
        active in the industry. She has authored children's books, provided
        voice work in films like "Despicable Me" and "Shrek," and hosted the
        Netflix series "Julie's Greenroom." Andrews' legacy as Maria von Trapp
        endures, and she is widely respected for her contributions to
        entertainment and her graceful resilience in the face of personal and
        professional challenges.

        In 1965, Christopher Plummer starred as Captain Georg von Trapp in "The
        Sound of Music," bringing depth and gravitas to the role of the strict
        but loving father. Although Plummer initially viewed the film with some
        disdain, his performance was pivotal in balancing the film's emotional
        and musical elements. Over the decades, Plummer evolved into a highly
        respected and versatile actor, known for a wide range of roles in film,
        television, and theater. He earned critical acclaim and numerous awards,
        including an Academy Award for "Beginners" in 2012, becoming the oldest
        actor to win an Oscar at that time. Until his passing in 2021, Plummer
        continued to work prolifically, leaving behind a legacy as one of the
        finest actors of his generation.
