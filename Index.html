      </h4>
      <p>
        One summer night, my family sat down to watch our next family movie
        night film. This one was a staple movie, our dad had told us.
        <em>The Sound of Music.</em> I had never heard of it, but I was enticed
        by my own unfamiliarity with something supposedly so culturally
        significant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five years later, I cannot imagine myself without this movie. No movie
        has ever surpassed the love I feel for the Sound of Music. It has been
        embedded in my personality all these years, from its nostalgia to the
        authenticity of its music, and especially its heartwarming characters
        that have remained in my heart ever since I first watched the film.
      </p>
      <p>
        In retrospect, I suspect that on that quiet summer night, I had,
        unbeknownst to me, felt the deep, imminent sensation that I was about to
        witness a consequential turning point in my life. This movie was my
        first grand introduction to a world of film, setting the stage for a
        world I would not revisit until my post-pandemic adolescent years—during
        which I’m still navigating my passions for the art of video and
        filmmaking. In this critical stage, I felt obliged to call tribute to
        the very inspiration that started it all.
      </p>
      <em>
        <p>
          Here is a digital time-capsule dedicated to a timeless movie that
          hopefully continues to leave its legacy as a timeless treasure in
          cinematic history. As the keeper of this music box, I will do my best
          to commemorate the Sound of Music’s memory.
