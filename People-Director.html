        Chosen to direct the film in 1962 by American screenwriter Ernest
        Lehman. Getting Wise to take over this movie was not an easy feat, but
        Lehman knew he had to be the one directing the film. Wise’s earlier
        projects included The Curse of the Cat People and West Side Story. After
        the Sound of Music, he directed a couple of other films (Star!, Star
        Trek: The Motion Picture, and more) until he shifted to a career as
        president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science. Wise passed
        away from a heart attack in September 2005 at age 91.

      <h4 class="small-yellow-text">(1915-2005)</h4>

      <p>
        Ernest Lehman, a renowned screenwriter in the mid-1960s, was already
        celebrated for his work on films like "North by Northwest" and "West
        Side Story" when he adapted "The Sound of Music" for the big screen. His
        exceptional screenplay was key to the film's immense success, blending
        humor, emotion, and music seamlessly. The adaptation became one of the
        most beloved musicals ever, cementing Lehman's reputation as a masterful
        storyteller. Although he passed away in 2005, Lehman's legacy endures,
        with his work continuing to influence screenwriters and filmmakers, and
        "The Sound of Music" standing as a testament to his remarkable talent.

        Although he never officially admitted to it, the reason Robert Wise
        agreed to direct The Sound of Music was because Lehman had smuggled a
        copy of his screenplay to Wise’s agent! While Wise was reluctant to take
        on the musical-adaptation at first, he was pleasantly surprised after
        reading Lehman’s script and decided the movie had potential.

        Richard ​​Rodgers and Oscars Hammerstein II, the legendary musical
        theater duo, were responsible for composing the music and lyrics for The
        Sound of Music. Their collaboration on this classic musical resulted in
        memorable songs such as "Edelweiss," "My Favorite Things," and
        "Do-Re-Mi," which have become iconic in the realm of musical theater.
        Their work on The Sound of Music not only showcased their talent for
        creating emotionally resonant and melodic compositions but also cemented
        their legacy as pioneering figures in American musical theater.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their company, The Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, still continues
        to play a crucial role in producing and licensing their musicals,
        ensuring that the legacy of their works is preserved and that they
        continue to be performed and appreciated by new audiences.
