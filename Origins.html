      <p>
        The von Trapp family originated with Georg von Trapp, an
        Austro-Hungarian naval officer, and his first wife, Agatha. After
        Agatha's death, Georg married Maria Kutschera, a novice from Nonnberg
        Abbey. The family, initially bonding through music, began performing
        publicly after winning a Salzburg music competition in 1936. With the
        Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938, they fled to the United States,
        where they continued their musical career as the Trapp Family Singers
        and settled in Vermont. Their story inspired the 1956 German film and
        the Broadway musical, culminating in the famous 1965 movie. Today, the
        Trapp Family Lodge in Vermont, operated by their descendants, remains a
        testament to their enduring legacy.

        Their full story can be found in the book The Story of the Trapp Family
        Singers, written by none other than Maria von Trapp herself.

        The making of "The Sound of Music" is a remarkable journey that began
        with this very book, inspiring a 1956 German film that later caught the
        attention of Broadway producers. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein
        II adapted the story into a stage musical, premiering in 1959 and
        becoming a huge success.
